### We expect that this method will be able to subdivide our anomalies (previously detected) as the following:

- ðŸŸ¢ `OK` -> normal data. If true, then the algorythm will be able to keep the mission active;
- ðŸ”µ `Mild Level` -> keep flying cautiously;
- ðŸŸ¡ `Moderate Level` -> go to the nearest waypoint;
- ðŸŸ  `Critical Level` -> land on this location;
